# Quick start

This module is a build environment, so you won't run any commands directly. Local testing requires Netlify, which is installed from the parent module.

The minimal example to get up and running is:

```bash
make oceanics-io-api/build
make run & # run Netlify dev stack, use another terminal
make test
```
