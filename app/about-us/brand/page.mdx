# Brand

Our public presence is primarily through digital media, so attention to presentation and consistency in these channels is important to us. To that end, this covers the types of media and brand marks we invest in.

## Marks

Our company is Oceanicsdotio LLC. The operating form, in order of preference, is one of:

- oceanics.io
- Oceanics.io
- Oceanicsdotio
- oceanicsdotio
- oceanics-io

## Copy

Language should be as straight forward as possible, while retaining technical density. Basically, know what you are talking about, and don't dumb it down.

Less is more, and I personally hate adverbs. Sans serif almost always, except for print. Large fonts, moderate white space.

### Short form copy and tagline examples

- Situational awareness for a changing ocean
- Ocean analytics as a service
- Trust layer for the blue economy

## Visual media

No stock photography or corporate memphis.

Images should support written copy, and be licensed from photographers/artists when possible. Creative work sourced from independent designers is preferred. It is not acceptable to use predatory multi-artist bidding systems.

Video is a major web performance and accessibility risk.

Video should be used sparingly, for purposes to which it is best suited, especially conveying large amounts of information quickly in a educational or news context.
