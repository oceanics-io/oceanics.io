  We are www.oceanics.io. We value diverse contributions regardless of technical skill, domain knowledge, or ability and do not suffer discrimination or harassment. We invite questions, listen more than speak, and adopt a “yes/and” over a “no/but” mentality.  

  When you arrive we record your address, user agent, mouse, keystrokes, and location. If you log in, we give you a token that expires in one hour. These data are never transmitted or shared, and can be viewed and deleted with the token. 
  
  Metadata are used to tune software and models that make AI more Accessible. Our derived products are collaborative, public, and follow community standards. We manage risk with backups, monitoring, encryption, and robust physical security.
  
  Let us know how we can do great work better together at business-at-oceanics-dot-io.
