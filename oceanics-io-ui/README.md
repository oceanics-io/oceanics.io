## Quick start 

This contains base React components and hooks to be re-used across applications. 

Installation is with `yarn workspace oceanics-io-ui install`. A post install command will cause the TypeScript compiler to do it's thing. You can also run this manually with the `build` command.

For development, we use Storybook. The `start` command will launch a development server and open a browser. The `build-storybook` command create static HTML suitable for deployment to Netlify or another static site service.

You should not need to manually build this workspace.
