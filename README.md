# Bathysphere API

This document provides guidance for installing and developing on Bathysphere. For instructions on interacting with an existing deployment, please see the [API specification](https://graph.oceanics.io).

Bathysphere is a distributed store and registry for public and proprietary geospatial data. The system is designed to support aquaculture research in the Gulf of Maine, but can be configured and extended for other applications. It ingests sensor and model data and metadata, and parses them into discoverable databases. It can, for instance, act as a hub for IoT applications.

The services run in Docker containers, which are configured to receive and route low-level instructions between computing environments and networked devices. The runtime supports parallelism, and the web service can scale out to meet high throughput or high availability requirements. Deployment is with `docker-compose` or Kubernetes.

| Service             | Port   | Description                |
| ------------------- | ------ | -------------------------- |
| `nginx`             | `80`   | OpenAPI specification      |
| `bathysphere_graph` | `5000` | Graph API                  |
| `neo4j`             | `7687` | Neo4j Bolt protocol access |
| `neo4j`             | `7474` | Neo4j built-in browser GUI |



Data are persisted in cloud object storage. The default implementation uses `minio` as a client to make requests to an `oceanics.io` data lake.  

A development environment can be deployed locally with `docker-compose up -d`. 

### Kubernetes on DigitalOcean

Create a new personal access token then authorize your environment using `doctl auth init`.

Download the cluster configuration, and get the nodes. The cluster doesn't need `nginx`, so we just deploy the `neo4j` container and the `bathysphere-graph` container:

```bash
doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save $CLUSTER_NAME
cd ~/.kube && kubectl --kubeconfig="$CLUSTER_NAME-kubeconfig.yaml" get nodes
```

A monitoring dashboard can be installed into the cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.0.0-beta4/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml
kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard describe secret $(kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get secret | grep admin-user | awk '{print $1}')
```

The ingress controller for the cluster:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/nginx-0.26.1/deploy/static/mandatory.yaml
```



### OpenFaaS

Functions-as-a-Service ([FaaS](https://github.com/openfaas/workshop/blob/master)) can be deployed automatically on DigitalOcean and other cloud providers. Extensions to the core API are provided through the `/functions` end point by an `openfaas` gateway. 

```bash
apt install faas-cli
faas-cli list --verbose
faas-cli login --password $OPENFAAS_KEY
```



Functions used by `bathysphere` must have HMAC for cryptographic verification. A key is stored in `openfass` that will be used to validate requests. 

```bash
faas-cli new --lang python3-http buoys --prefix=oceanicsdotio
echo -n $HMAC_KEY | faas-cli secret create payload-secret
```



Build and deploy a specific function `faas-cli up -f buoys.yml`, or the full contents of a `stack.yml` file with, simply, `faas-cli up`. Some examples of invoking the included functions:



```bash
# Get buoy data
echo -n '{"id": 66, "limit": 10, "observedProperties": ["temperature", "salinity"], "encoding": "json"}' | faas-cli invoke buoy-data --sign hmac --key=$HMAC_KEY

# Send an e-mail containing credentials
echo -n '{"subject": "Account Info", "addresses": ["user@example.com"], "message": "your-secret-thing"}' | faas-cli invoke notify --sign hmac --key=$HMAC_KEY

# Dump the contents of a `postgres` table:
echo -n '{"table": "test"}' | faas-cli invoke postgres --sign hmac --key=$HMAC_KEY

```



## Neo4j

The database manager runs in the [official container image](https://hub.docker.com/_/neo4j/), and maps the server ports to an external interface. The [built-in GUI](http://localhost:7474/browser/) is at  `hostname:7474`, and the `bolt` [interface](https://boltprotocol.org/) defaults to  `hostname:7687`. 

Bolt is used for API calls from Python scripts. User authorization requires the environment variable `NEO4J_AUTH`. 

If you are new to Neo4j, try deploying a stand-alone graph container first:

```bash
docker run \
	--publish=7474:7474 \
  --publish=7473:7473 \
	--publish=7687:7687 \
	--volume=$HOME/neo4j/data:/data \
	oceanicsdotio/neo4j
```



### Docker Machine (Basic)

Create a new node:

```bash
# src/docker-machine-create.sh
docker-machine create \
--driver digitalocean \
--digitalocean-size s-2vcpu-4gb \
--digitalocean-access-token $DOCKER_MACHINE_PAK \
bathysphere-api-neo4j
```



Connect you local environment to issue commands to the remote docker service:

```bash
eval $(docker-machine env bathysphere-api-neo4j)
```



Setup the node remotely through an `ssh` tunnel, and install `certbot`:

```bash
docker-machine ssh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y certbot
```



### Helm

A cluster can be deployed to Kubernetes using `helm`. Get the deployment environment setup:

```bash
brew install kubernetes-helm
helm init
helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
kubectl get deployments -l 'app=helm' --all-namespaces
```

Install the application:

```bash
helm install \
--namespace bathysphere \
--name neo4j-helm stable/neo4j \
--set acceptLicenseAgreement=yes \
--set neo4jPassword=n0t_passw0rd

kubectl logs -l "app=neo4j,component=core"

helm delete neo4j-helm --purge
kubectl scale deployment neo4j-helm-neo4j-replica  --namespace bathysphere --replicas=2
kubectl exec neo4j-helm-neo4j-core-0 -- bin/cypher-shell \
"UNWIND range(0, 1000) AS id CREATE (:Person {id: id}) RETURN COUNT(*)"
```

Execute a query against the cluster:

```bash
kubectl run -it \
--rm cypher-shell \
--image=neo4j:3.2.3-enterprise \
--restart=Never \
--namespace bathysphere \
--command -- ./bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p n0t_passw0rd \
--a neo4j-helm-neo4j.bathysphere.svc.cluster.local "call dbms.cluster.overview()"
```



### Cypher

[Cypher](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-refcard/current/) is the Neo4j query language. Either can be used to build the database, traverse nodes and edges, and return data. You can manage the database with the Python `neo4j-driver` package, installed with `pip install neo4j-driver`. 

Establish a connection to the database using Bolt, and start a session:

```python
from neo4j.v1 import GraphDatabase
driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "neo4j"))
session = driver.session()
```

Using a 3D model as an example, here are some basic queries. 

Return a specific triangle, child vertices, and their relationships:

```sql
MATCH (v:Vertex)-[]->(t:Triangle {id: 100})
RETURN v, t
```

Return neighbor indices of vertices connected to a named vertex through a named parent:

```sql
MATCH (:Vertex {id: 118})-[]->(:Triangle {id: 100})<-[]-(v:Vertex)
RETURN n.id
```

Return the number of  within 2 strides of named element,

```sql
MATCH (v:Vertex)-[*1..3]-(t:Triangle {id: 152})
RETURN count(DISTINCT v)
```

Return the center coordinates of a triangle,

```sql
MATCH (v:Vertex)-[]-(:Triangle {id: 10000})
RETURN avg(v.x), 
```



Nodes are neighbors if they share a parent. Each node gets a **non-directional** neighbor relationship with unique nodes that joined by a parent:

```sql
MATCH (a:Node)-[:SIDE_OF]->(:Cell)<-[:SIDE_OF]-(b:Node) 
MERGE (a)-[:NEIGHBORS]-(b)
```

Cells are neighbors if they share two child nodes. Crawling all node and cell combinations would be really slow, and we already created edges as neighbor relationships between nodes. Use those to create cell neighbors, since they are one-to-one, **with one notable exception**. Edges joining boundary nodes will not have cell-cell neighbor relationships.

```
MATCH (a:Node {id: 0})
MATCH (a)-->(b)-[:SIDE_OF]->(c:Element)<-[:SIDE_OF]-(a)
WITH collect(DISTINCT c.id) AS candidates
MATCH 
RETURN candidates

MATCH (a)-->(b)--(c)--(a)
MATCH (b)-->(candidates:Element)<--(c)
WITH DISTINCT candidates AS unique, parents
WITH collect(unique.id) AS cans, collect(parents.id) AS pars
RETURN apoc.coll.intersection(cans, pars)

RETURN a.id, b.id, c.id

WITH a, b
MATCH (a)-[:SIDE_OF]->(e:Element)
UNWIND b.id AS nb
MATCH p = (:Node {id: nb})-[:SIDE_OF]->(e)<--(a)
RETURN e.id

UNWIND b.id as nb
MATCH (:Node {id: nb})-->(start:Element)<--(a)-[:NEIGHBORS]->(:Node {id: nb})->(end:Element)<--(a)
RETURN nb.id, b.id, e.id
```



### Ingestion tips

Finite-volume methods need to perform mesh interpolations, the algorithms for which involve keeping the mesh and fields in memory. For an unstructured grid, the graph nodes include nodes/vertices in the simulation mesh, along with elements, edges, and layers. A vertex would have parent elements and edges, and have adjacency with other verticesâ€”and could have any number of associated environmental variables. Edges have child nodes, and parent elements. Their properties include boundary information. Surfaces are also a helpful construct, for representing the seafloor and air-water interface (or other isopycnal). 



#### Pre-processing

Meshes are often stored as NetCDF files. These can be read remotely by mounting the host volume to your local environment. For instance, using [fuse](https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/releases) and [sshfs](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs). On macOS `meson` and `ninja` are required, before downloading the `sshfs` tarball, installing it,

```bash
pip install meson
brew install ninja
gzip -d sshfs-3.3.2.tar.gz
tar -xvf sshfs-3.3.2.tar
cd sshfs-3.3.2
mkdir build
cd build
meson ..
sudo ninja install 
```

To mount the remote file system locally,

```bash
mkdir ~/remote/
sshfs username@hostname:/nfs-home/username/>>export ~/remote/
```

Topology may also simply be saved in CSV files, for which pre-processing might be necessary. For example, space-delimited files can be converted to comma-delimited using `sed`, `cat`, and `cut`:

```bash
sed 's/[[:blank:]]/,/g' midcoast_nodes.csv > neo4j_nodes.csv
sed 's/[[:blank:]]/,/g' midcoast_elements.csv > neo4j_elements.csv
sed 's/,,/,/g' neo4j_elements.csv > new_elements.csv
cat new_elements.csv | cut -c 2- > neo4j_elements.csv
```

A single triangular element/cell in a 2-D mesh consists of seven graph nodes: three vertices, three edges, and one element. The former are related to the latter by the `SIDE_OF` relationship. The vertices and edges are shared by other edges and elements, which they are also `SIDE_OF`.



#### Load

CSV data are ingested with `LOAD CSV`, which [loads data](https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-import-csv/) from a uniform resource identifier (URI). Vertices are loaded first, and relationships built in the second call. The process calls `CREATE` for each line of the input file. Explicit IDs are used for mapping between global and local domains when partitioning the graph. The files need to be in `/var/lib/neo4j/import` of the database container. At this point, it it worth noting, that if data entry goes wrong, you can abort and remove all nodes and relationships with `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n`.

Create nodes/vertices:

```sql
USING PERIODIC COMMIT
LOAD CSV FROM "file:///neo4j_nodes.csv" AS line
CREATE (n:Node { id: toInteger(line[0]), latitude: toFloat(line[1]), longitude: toFloat(line[2]), depth: toFloat(line[3]) })
```

Create elements:

```sql
USING PERIODIC COMMIT
LOAD CSV FROM "file:///neo4j_elements.csv" AS line
CREATE ( e:Element { id: toInteger(line[0]) } )
```

To limit future results to non-duplicates, enforce:

```sql
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (e:Element) ASSERT e.id IS UNIQUE
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (n:Node) ASSERT n.id IS UNIQUE
```

This automatically creates an index on ID. Depending on the structure of your queries, it may be useful to manually index a property, such as the node ID. Adding an index is quick and speeds up queries, but takes up more memory, so de-index when not in use,

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON :Node(id)
CREATE INDEX ON :Element(id)
DROP INDEX ON :Node(id)
DROP INDEX ON :Element(id)
```

Parent-child relationships are created in an additional pass. This reads the elements file again, and sets vertices `SIDE_OF` elements.

```sql
USING PERIODIC COMMIT
LOAD CSV FROM "file:///neo4j_elements.csv" AS line
MATCH ( n1:Node { id: toInteger(line[1]) } ), \
( n2:Node { id: toInteger(line[2]) } ), \
( n3:Node { id: toInteger(line[3]) } ), \
( e:Element { id: toInteger(line[0]) } )
CREATE (n1)-[:SIDE_OF]->(e)
CREATE (n2)-[:SIDE_OF]->(e)
CREATE (n3)-[:SIDE_OF]->(e)
```



#### Benchmark

The University of Maine Midcoast mesh on a late model MacBook:

* CSV files = 15 MB

- 165,632 nodes with 662,498 properties  (ID, latitude, longitude, and depth) = 8061â€“9460 ms
- 322,546 elements with 322,546 properties (ID) = 7993â€“9071 ms. 
- 967,638 relationships = 51,360 ms
- Database volume = 385 MB



## Postgres

The backend uses the `postgres` relational database, with the `timescale` and `postgis` extensions for time series and geospatial data, respectively. To work directly with a relational database, run a container, and enter the `postgres` instance with the `exec` command:

```bash
docker run -d --name timescaledb -p 5432:5432 -e
	POSTGRES_PASSWORD=n0t_passw0rd
	timescale/timescaledb-postgis
docker exec -it timescaledb-postgis psql -U postgres
```

A database is manually created and extended with, 

```sql
CREATE database bathysphere;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb CASCADE;
```
