    - Red and green are not used to indicate important information that would be missed by those with colorblindness.
    - is the design flexibile enough to adapt to new cases and scenarios without requiring fundamental changes to the code?
    - The exposed abstractions are meaningful to operators.

    - Multi-selection inputs are easy to use and clear.
    - There is not redundant information and labels.
    - Data and analytics services follow any standard.
    - Text forms use auto-complete and fuzzy matching.

  description: |
    Choosing tools which do not take accessibility into mind will make it harder to hire people to use it in the future.

  criteria:
    - Support for the native language of your collaborators or partners.
    - Can be used by any of your employees, with limited specialized knowledge or training.


Keeping your secrets safe:

    to maintain trade secrets. 

  criteria:
    - SSL is kept up to date.

Getting help:
  description: |
    Read the manual. Can you do self-service troubleshooting based on the technical and support documentation alone?
    Maybe there is a user community that you can go to for extra help. The truth is though, no everyone is outgoing or has 
    the time to track down info. In those cases, you'll want to be able to reach support. If support is not in your language
    or time zone, or if you are a small fry that doesn't warrant the trouble, you'll be on your own. 

  criteria:
    - Support is available in your time zone.
    - More than one person supports the product.
    - Support is provided by the creator of the product.
    - Support is included in the price, or the cost is transparent.
    - The company uses formal code review and quality control.
    - Source code is available.
    - Documentation includes a UML diagram or explanation of how database models are related.
    - There is self-service documentation, external to the application, so that users can troubleshoot and resolve issues whether or not they have access to support.


License/Legal:
  description: |
    Read the license, or the End User License Agreeement. It's probably a standard thing. For a mobile application that costs a few dollars
    that is OK. For bespoke software costing hundreds or thousands of dollars per month, that is going to help run your operation and keep you people safe, it is entirely appropriate to
    negotiate the terms. 

  criteria:
  - You own the data you put into the system? Is this clear? Do you have the right to remove it at any time?
  - Can you make changes to the product?
  - Possible to provide secure access to data for third parties with restrictions.
  - Terms are governed by courts that are reasonably accessible to you.
  - The reverse engineering clause will not prevent you from using or making tools that you need.
  - Non-compete clauses have clear geographic and time boundaries.


Working in the field:
  description: |

    - Satellite and aerial imagery is off by default.
    - You can find locations with and without coordinates or names.

Technology:
  criteria:
    - How are the products and tools delivered?
    - Is the architecture platform independent?
    - What kind of security is used?
    - The product integrates with any tools you use, or plan to use.
