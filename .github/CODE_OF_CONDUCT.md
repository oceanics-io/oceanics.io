We value full expression of identity, and diversity in ideas, skills, and contributions regardless of technical or domain knowledge. Members and participants are encouraged to invite questions, listen as much as they speak, and adopt a “yes/and” over a “no/but” mentality.

We provide an environment free from discrimination or harassment. We’ll engage an external mediator if there is disagreement in what constitutes harassment. If you or someone else are harassed in-person or online, contact a project member, and we will take action to resolve the situation safely. If you cannot reach a mediator, you should remove yourself from the situation or notify an appropriate emergency response agency.
