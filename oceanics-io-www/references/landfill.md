Landfill,

gleaming monuments to our hyper-cool ability to

(just for fun) ruin everything,

suggested an escape beyond a map,

an endless anti-place

of absolution from sin, carbon, and the eternal waste of sun gods.

Blood, history, adventure literature told us â€”

This is the realm of blue collar philosophy, where character matters,

flags are matters of convenience, a landlessness of opportunity.

So we capitulated the shores for coursing brine

and an aura of ancient rime.

Thank you for ruining it too.

That was our escape - our surrender to the world.

You take the teeming shore,

but leave the waves to the dreamers.
