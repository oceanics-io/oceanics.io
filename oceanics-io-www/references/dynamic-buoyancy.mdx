## Background

Cyanobacteria are notorious for the dense, green scums they form on water bodies the world over. 

Blooms are increasingly common due to changing nutrient regimes and changing temperatures, and this means more incidents of human and animal toxicity. Because, of course they produce potent neurological toxins.

The genera Anabaena and Microcystis share similar phenomenological behavior. They out-compete con-specifics by using specialized stages and cells for quiescence, acquiring nutrients, and creating buoyancy.

The buoyancy bit is the most interesting. Both types use a combination of lighter-than-water proteins and gas vesicles, but the method of controlling the effect varies. 

Anabaena relies on vesicle collapse, basically purging gas to descend like a diver. This results in a hysteresis, where the method of action is different for increasing or decreasing buoyancy. 

Microcystis instead chemically alters the ratio of carbohydrate and protein move, like, well, a chemical ballast.

People I have see embark on a dynamic buoyancy engineering project do the first bit, while thinking they are doing the second. The second is harder to achieve, but provides better control. I hope engineers new to marine operations will incorporate solid, displacement, and dynamic buoyancy, as this can be safer and prevent catastrophic loss. 

To incorporate any vertical moving agent into high-resolution hydrodynamic models, or to have a hope for remote autonomous control you need a rigorous definition of vertical movement. 

The Microsystis way relies on the balance of carbohydrate (C) and protein (M).

Q: Does a diel vertical migration model translate to shallower lakes, and does it result in surface accumulation? 
Q: What is the fate of excreted toxins? Does vertical migration 
create a non-uniform toxin profile?

Conclusions
- High temperature results in surface accumulation.
- Toxin intensifies in the upper water column.
- Colony size modulates timing and depth (artifact).
