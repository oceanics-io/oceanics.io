The journey of a molecule related by Aldo Leopold<br/>
is an exercise in poignant prose;<br/>
but here, if I may be so bold,<br/>
I make an effort to transpose<br/>
his Odyssey, to the lexicon of biogeochemistry.<br/><br/>

And since X is no fitting name for this history,<br/>
we will equally consider she<br/>
as carbon and as nitrogen,<br/>
and trace the path of N and C<br/>
from limestone cliff through cyclic sea.<br/><br/>

As NaNO3, nitrogen has well-known solubility.<br/>
and natural fertilizing ability;<br/>
but for those who prefer C<br/>
the mineral source can be<br/>
easily, ubiquitous deposits of CaCO3.<br/><br/>

First a plant took root up there,<br/>
and split the stone and let in air<br/>
bearing H2O and CO2,<br/>
from which carbonic acid grew<br/>
(with the carboxylic additions of oak root too),<br/><br/>

which weathered the rock, from whence the bur-oak drew<br/>
a solution of nitrate<br/>
some calcium bicarbonate,<br/>
which when assimilated may<br/>
eventually have constructed a strand of DNA.<br/>
<br/>

So were exhumed our fated friends, but to what end:<br/>
victim to assimilatory metabolism<br/>
and kept interred in organisms.<br/>
Turn by turn they onward flowed<br/>
until such time as their owner decomposed.<br/>
<br/>

Through each phase of this biological pump,<br/>
from plant to beast to human race,<br/>
both N and C keep different pace:<br/>
depending on their placement<br/>
as reactant or cellular cement.<br/>
<br/>

When an organism in which they'd happen to reside<br/>
would finally succumb to time's tide,<br/>
came then the turn of fungi<br/>
and hungry bacteria to ammonify,<br/>
and percolate the soil with carbon dioxide.<br/>
<br/>

Then a root would re-uptake, to assimilate in a leaf,<br/>
before a mouse physically bore them beneath<br/>
the surface realm of wind and rain<br/>
to there delay another refrain.<br/>
And while N and C wait to again respire<br/>
<br/>

biological cycling is halted by wildfire:<br/>
the combustion of biomass<br/>
oxidizing N and C en masse,<br/>
and losing N2 and CO2 to air<br/>
but storing charred organic matter beneath the surface soot.<br/>
<br/>

With the return of legumes and their bacteria-laden roots<br/>
nitrogen fixation from atmospheric<br/>
to NH4+ (always anaerobic),<br/>
which in turn was nitrified, to NO3-<br/>
which fueled respiration, and C again was free.<br/>
<br/>

So began a race, hydraulically transported by slope<br/>
with impetus again<br/>
derived from rain,<br/>
delayed by cyclic residence<br/>
in all manner of heterotroph.<br/>
<br/>

The seaward rush of N and C progressed until they found<br/>
themselves united in urea or aminos;<br/>
after sulphate reduction in anoxic silt<br/>
and dissimilatory metabolism, they plunge into<br/>
(presumably) the Gulf of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>

This entirely new system was not for Aldo to explore.<br/>
To cycles in the ocean, more pressing than on land,<br/>
he gave the brand<br/>
of prison, with which I disagree:<br/>
for no system is a prison in terms of biogeochemistry.<br/>
<br/>

While passing through a gateway estuary<br/>
the nutrient spiral roulette<br/>
could spit into the Atlantic<br/>
either inorganics,<br/>
or as here presumed: waste organic matter.<br/>
<br/>

DOC is dominant, one fifth of all the latter.<br/>
N is surface bio-limiting,<br/>
while C is bio-intermediate,<br/>
both can be dissolved or particulate:<br/>
a functional difference in size, meaning that one sinks<br/>
<br/>

while the distribution of DOM is circulation driven.<br/>
When in the euphotic zone<br/>
most forms of OM are, prone<br/>
to surface photochemical reduction,<br/>
and NH4+ driven regenerative production.<br/>
<br/>

Though rates vary by geography, N remineralization<br/>
occurs, first by ammonium-nitrate oxidation,<br/>
followed by denitrification<br/>
(to solute N2 and H3PO4),<br/>
then by metal ions, and sulphate reduction (of which I'll mention more).<br/>
<br/>

The generated biomass of net primary production,<br/>
feeds a chain of organisms<br/>
with less efficient metabolism,<br/>
this bio-pump trophically concentrates<br/>
once-dissolved OM into heavy fecal particulates.<br/>
<br/>

But this and other sinking POM will not go unused:<br/>
at aphotic depths it is reduced<br/>
to CO2 and nutrients<br/>
by heterotrophs reliant<br/>
on settling, and the vital circulation which upwells once more.<br/>
<br/>

Then the NO3- and CO2 are used by coccolithophores,<br/>
to fuel new production of their plates<br/>
from Ca2+ and bicarbonate,<br/>
and when the algae die, the CaCO3<br/>
quickly settles to benthos and becomes sedimentary.<br/>
<br/>

When I consider that only a quarter of OM<br/>
(regardless the sort)<br/>
makes it to the ocean floor<br/>
by settling or transport;<br/>
and 90% is re-mineralized for a few reactions more,<br/>
<br/>

I can say with confidence, that the chance is rather small,<br/>
that even through many iterations<br/>
they'll see the abyssal plain at all.<br/>
So, though C and N may languish<br/>
in sediment and solution and fish<br/>
<br/>

it's never so long, speaking geologically,<br/>
despite the volume of the sea,<br/>
before carbon and nitrogen<br/>
are returned to air and land<br/>
through crustal subduction and steady ebullition.<br/>
<br/>
