The journey of a molecule related by Aldo Leopold

is an exercise in poignant prose;

but here, if I may be so bold,

I make an effort to transpose

his Odyssey, to the lexicon of biogeochemistry.

<br/>

And since X is no fitting name for this history,

we will equally consider she

as carbon and as nitrogen,

and trace the path of N and C

from limestone cliff through cyclic sea.
<br/>

As NaNO3, nitrogen has well-known solubility.

and natural fertilizing ability;

but for those who prefer C

the mineral source can be

easily, ubiquitous deposits of CaCO3.
<br/>

First a plant took root up there,

and split the stone and let in air

bearing H2O and CO2,

from which carbonic acid grew

(with the carboxylic additions of oak root too),
<br/>

which weathered the rock, from whence the bur-oak drew

a solution of nitrate

some calcium bicarbonate,

which when assimilated may

eventually have constructed a strand of DNA.
<br/>

So were exhumed our fated friends, but to what end:

victim to assimilatory metabolism

and kept interred in organisms.

Turn by turn they onward flowed

until such time as their owner decomposed.
<br/>

Through each phase of this biological pump,

from plant to beast to human race,

both N and C keep different pace:

depending on their placement

as reactant or cellular cement.
<br/>

When an organism in which they'd happen to reside

would finally succumb to time's tide,

came then the turn of fungi

and hungry bacteria to ammonify,

and percolate the soil with carbon dioxide.

<br/>
Then a root would re-uptake, to assimilate in a leaf,

before a mouse physically bore them beneath

the surface realm of wind and rain

to there delay another refrain.

And while N and C wait to again respire
<br/>

biological cycling is halted by wildfire:

the combustion of biomass

oxidizing N and C en masse,

and losing N2 and CO2 to air

but storing charred organic matter beneath the surface soot.
<br/>

With the return of legumes and their bacteria-laden roots

nitrogen fixation from atmospheric

to NH4+ (always anaerobic),

which in turn was nitrified, to NO3-

which fueled respiration, and C again was free.
<br/>

So began a race, hydraulically transported by slope

with impetus again

derived from rain,

delayed by cyclic residence

in all manner of heterotroph.
<br/>

The seaward rush of N and C progressed until they found

themselves united in urea or aminos;

after sulphate reduction in anoxic silt

and dissimilatory metabolism, they plunge into

(presumably) the Gulf of Mexico.

<br/>
This entirely new system was not for Aldo to explore.

To cycles in the ocean, more pressing than on land,

he gave the brand

of prison, with which I disagree:

for no system is a prison in terms of biogeochemistry.
<br/>

While passing through a gateway estuary

the nutrient spiral roulette

could spit into the Atlantic

either inorganics,

or as here presumed: waste organic matter.
<br/>

DOC is dominant, one fifth of all the latter.

N is surface bio-limiting,

while C is bio-intermediate,

both can be dissolved or particulate:

a functional difference in size, meaning that one sinks
<br/>

while the distribution of DOM is circulation driven.

When in the euphotic zone

most forms of OM are, prone

to surface photochemical reduction,

and NH4+ driven regenerative production.

<br/>
Though rates vary by geography, N remineralization

occurs, first by ammonium-nitrate oxidation,

followed by denitrification

(to solute N2 and H3PO4),

then by metal ions, and sulphate reduction (of which I'll mention more).

<br/>
The generated biomass of net primary production,

feeds a chain of organisms

with less efficient metabolism,

this bio-pump trophically concentrates

once-dissolved OM into heavy fecal particulates.

<br/>
But this and other sinking POM will not go unused:

at aphotic depths it is reduced

to CO2 and nutrients

by heterotrophs reliant

on settling, and the vital circulation which upwells once more.
<br/>

Then the NO3- and CO2 are used by coccolithophores,

to fuel new production of their plates

from Ca2+ and bicarbonate,

and when the algae die, the CaCO3

quickly settles to benthos and becomes sedimentary.
<br/>

When I consider that only a quarter of OM

(regardless the sort)

makes it to the ocean floor

by settling or transport;

and 90% is remineralized for a few reactions more,
<br/>

I can say with confidence, that the chance is rather small,

that even through many iterations

they'll see the abyssal plain at all.

So, though C and N may languish

in sediment and solution and fish

<br/>
it's never so long, speaking geologically,

despite the volume of the sea,

before carbon and nitrogen

are returned to air and land

through crustal subduction and steady ebullition.
