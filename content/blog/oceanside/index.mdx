    A game about the working waterfront, getting along with your neighbors, 
    and respecting nature. Use real geospatial data to create synthetic ecosystems, 
    and see if you can intuit how they function.

## Tiles

### Wharf

Starting location, limits the distance that boats can travel before needing to refuel. 

### Lighthouse

The lighthouse tile cannot be built. It provides bonus points to activities nearby, and protects boats from being lost at sea.

### Laboratory

The laboratory reveals gulls.

### Gull

Gulls indicate that there is a hidden feature on a tile. These can be converted to activity tiles by being near a laboratory, or being visited by a boat.

### Empty

Empty tiles are empty. Empty tiles are worth points if they are next to other empty tiles. 

### Oysters

Oysters are delicious! Leave them in the water for points, or harvest them and sell them. 

### Mussels

Mussels are good! If they are too close to oysters though, they will eventually take over. 

### Fish pen

Finfish are worth the most, but be careful, bad things can happen.

### Lobster buoys

Boats can put out and recover lobster traps! Don't molest yuor neighbors traps, or you'll get in trouble. 

### Boat

Gotta have a boat to work on the water.


### Diver

The boat can turn into a diver to investigate things underwater and do harvest activities.
