    I see people make bad deals with unscrupulous people for medicore software. This rubric
    is intended to help businesses on the water evaluate tools (and their providers) to ensure that
    you are buying what you think you are, and aren't going to run into surprises that drive up the 
    total cost of ownership.

"Every business is a software business". 
Whether you use internal or external software products to manage and evolve your operations, 
your tool choices dictate how fast you can respond to changes in the natural, business, and regulatory environment.

This guide is intended to help you assess software used to manage data and assets on and in the water. 
Marine research and industry have suffered through decades of low-quality software that is hard to use, 
and locks people into specific ecosystems. Moving forward, we hope marine operators will demand more 
from companies selling software products, and will coordinate with each other to develop and 
cultivate platforms for information sharing. This is an old idea, with a name, **platform collectives**.

To evaluate a product, you will need access to the full software suite, or a representative demo. 
You should **never make a decision without trialing it first**, as many design flaws are difficult to 
spot from feature lists and screenshots.

It is fine if you donâ€™t understand some of the criteria! Just skip it, the rubric is not a quantitative tool, 
which is why these are framed as true/false statements. **Existing products may only check a few boxes**.
