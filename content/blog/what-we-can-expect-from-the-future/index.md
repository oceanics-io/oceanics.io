    A time travelling letter from a 13 year old student in Mr. Perry's 2001 junior high science class. Presented verbatim after being in a time capsule for 20 years. Something's really never change.

What can we expect from the future? Will it be a shattered landscape of ruins or a verdant utopia? One major factor will be pollution. I believe that in 75-100 years our world (mainly our atmosphere) is going to be quite on its way to ruin unless we make more of an attempt to stop atmosphere-deteriorating chemical from being released. We will need to find a replacement for such harmful products as aerosols, or we will be living underwater (the greenhouse effect will melt the ice caps and the sea level will rise). Another horrible thing will happen if we don't stop the poisoning of our world: the rare animals and even more common animals and plants will start to die off. This will disrupt the food chain, leaving only humans who will have to survive on synthetic foods made from algae, which will be the only thing thriving. Yes, that's what going to happen if we don't shape up.

The above is almost inevitable since not that many people really want to put forward the effort needed and so we must put more of this nations' and every other nation's budget into the space program. This way, when the Earth gets to the point when it not suited to live on, we can escape on space ships capable of taking us to a Lunar or Martian base where the human race can expand further from. One day we will have to escape and we might as well develop the capability now.
