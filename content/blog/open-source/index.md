Graph database company Neo4j [secured](https://neo4j.com/blog/80-million-series-e/) $80M in funding to keep up their magic.

The Economist reported on IBM [buying](https://www.economist.com/business/2018/11/01/big-blues-takeover-of-red-hat-could-produce-an-uber-cloud) Red Hat for $34B, primarily to acquire their managed Kubernetes service

Our analytics stack use both of these tools. 

This gives me hope for the future of container clusters and graph databases.
