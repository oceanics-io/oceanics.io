    Despite my adversarial relation with React as Node.js, I but the bullet
    and made a new website to replace the turn-key Wordpress we've been rocking
    for two years.

Major overhaul of the website, and lots of fun stuff in the pipeline.

The blog portion of the site has been running on a Wordpress droplet on DigitalOcean for a while now. I wasn't
sure what exactly I wanted to do, but since by lease needed to be renewed, and the `.io`
domains ain't cheap, new and shiny is the way to go.

I don't love `react`, but figured this would be the best opportunity to dig on
a project without any external deadlines. I have used it professionally, but find
frameworks in general kind of annoying. 

Since I write mostly in markdown, `gatsbyjs` is a great option. It kind of pushed the  `react`
adoption. 

The previous process of logging in and editing posts was annoying. Now I just
commit updates to a Bitbucket repository, and a webhook kicks of a build stage on Netlify.
I tried using the Netlify CMS extension to `gatsby`, but it didn't add any utility for me. 
Hopefully the ease of doing this way will encourage me to write more.

Supposedly it's something I'm good at, but the results have been lackluster recently. 
I have been adding old content to the page. These are not 100% error free, and I'm still
correcting some of the LaTeX, but maybe they can be useful to others.
